# Smart-Home-Node-RED

This repository contains a smart home automation project and a dashboard built using Node-RED. The system allows control and monitoring of various household appliances such as fans, lights, air conditioners, and kitchen devices (e.g., oven, fridge) along with real-time weather data monitoring. The user interface is built using the Node-RED dashboard, providing a user-friendly way to interact with the devices.
